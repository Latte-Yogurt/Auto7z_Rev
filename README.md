- The main interface looks like this.
- **Volume Size:** refers to the expected size of the volumes you want to generate for the compressed file. If the input file is larger than the specified size, it will automatically be split into multiple compressed volumes.
- **Generate Format:** refers to the format you want the compressed file to be in. Note: the operations for generating tar and tar.zst files do not support adding a password.
- **Add Password:** means to add a password to the generated compressed file, with the default being empty, indicating no password will be added.
- **Save config on exit:** means that the settings will be automatically saved upon exiting the program, and it is enabled by default.
- The usage methods are twofold: dragging and dropping files or folders into the window, and dragging and dropping files or folders onto the program icon.
